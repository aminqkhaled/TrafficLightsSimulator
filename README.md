By default the traffic light is green for vehicles (e.g. cars) and the white and orange lights for pedestrians are off. By pressing the push button the traffic light for vehicles switches from green to yellow to red, and the traffic lights for pedestrians (i.e designated by the white and the orange LEDs) will turn on sequentially; the white LED will turn on signalling the pedestrians's turn in traffic, and then shortly the white light switches to blinking orange that tells the pedestrians that there turn is about to end (similar to the countdown in real traffic lights).
